# üçï Pizza Sales Analysis with SQL

This project involves analyzing pizza sales data using SQL queries to derive valuable insights about sales performance and trends. The dataset comprises four interconnected tables: `orders`, `orders_details`, `pizzas`, and `pizza_types`.

## üìä Key Highlights

- Solved **5 Basic**, **5 Intermediate**, and **3 Advanced** SQL questions.
- Used aggregate functions like `SUM`, `AVG`, and window functions such as `RANK` and `OVER`.
- Utilized various types of `JOINs` to combine data across multiple tables for comprehensive analysis.
- Provided actionable insights into sales patterns, popular pizza types, revenue distribution, and more.

## üîç Dataset Overview

- **Tables:**
  - `orders`: Contains order-level details such as order ID, date, and time.
  - `order_details`: Tracks individual pizza quantities and their association with orders.
  - `pizzas`: Includes pizza ID and price.
  - `pizza_types`: Describes the pizza categories and names.

## üõ†Ô∏è SQL Concepts Covered

1. **Basic Queries:**
   - Extracted overall sales performance metrics.
   - Grouped data by pizza categories and months.

2. **Intermediate Queries:**
   - Used `JOIN` operations (e.g., `INNER JOIN`) to analyze category-wise distribution.
   - Calculated average pizzas sold per day and top-performing products.

3. **Advanced Queries:**
   - Performed revenue analysis using window functions (`RANK`, `OVER`).
   - Combined data using multiple `JOINs` for detailed cumulative sales trends.
   - Calculated percentage contribution of pizza categories to total revenue.

## üîç Insights Derived

- Identified the **top-selling pizza categories** and their revenue contributions.
- Revealed sales trends by **hour, day, and month** for operational efficiency.
- Discovered high-revenue-generating pizzas for strategic promotions.

## üìÇ Repository Content

- **SQL Queries**: Organized into Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced categories.
- **Joins**: Comprehensive use of `JOIN` operations to merge data across tables.
- **Insights**: Documented for each query to highlight business implications.
- **Presentation**: A professional PPT summarizing the findings.
